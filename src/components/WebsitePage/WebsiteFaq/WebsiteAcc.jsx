              SEO is essential as it keeps the search results accurate. The
              higher you rank in results pages, the more clicks and traffic your
              site will get. It also enhances the user experience, making it
              more likely for customers to become repeat buyers. It is also
              cost-effective.

              Local SEO makes your business stand out even if you do not have a
              website and helps online leads generate more traffic to your
              business. Because these leads come from people who are explicitly
              looking for the products or services that your company provides,
              you may expect a high conversion rate.

              Boost in organic traffic is a great sign that your SEO is
              performing. An increase in the number of pages that you are
              ranking for means that your SEO is working and in the number of
              searches online for your company’s name shows SEO is working.
